### About 

**<font size="3">This addon is meant to provide additional info about IC2Classic machines/blocks when Jade mod is loaded.</font>**

<img src="images/full.png">

**<font size="3">Almost every aspect of the mod is covered, except some parts that require much deeper knowledge which I don't possess at this moment.</font>**

**<font size="3">These parts are:</font>**
- several structures (Multiblock Tank, Steam Tunnel) - for more info you'll have to check the main block or the valve, sorry.

**<font size="3">Everything else is working just fine.</font>**

**<font size="3">Make sure to check the Config (NUM0 by default)</font>**
