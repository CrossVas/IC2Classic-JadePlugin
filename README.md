**<font size="6">Jade Plugin For IC2Classic - Minecraft 1.19.2</font>**

**<font size="5">Qui quaerit, reperit...</font>**

### About 

**<font size="3">This ~~junk of code~~ addon is meant to provide additional support for IC2Classic when Jade mod is loaded.</font>**

**<font size="3">Almost every aspect of the mod is covered, except some parts that require much deeper knowledge which I don't possess at this moment.</font>**

**<font size="3">These parts are:</font>**
 - Item tubes - because I'm too dumb to understand how to transfer data; 
 - several structures (Multiblock Tank, Steam Tunnel) - for more info you'll have to check the main block or the valve, sorry.

**<font size="3">Everything else is working just fine.</font>**

**<font size="3">Make sure to check the Config (NUM0 by default)</font>**
