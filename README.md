# Jade Plugin For IC2Classic - Minecraft 1.19.2

## Qui quaerit, reperit...

### About 

#### This ~~junk of code~~ addon is meant to provide additional support for IC2Classic when Jade mod is loaded.
#### Almost every aspect of the mod is covered, except some parts that require much deeper knowledge which I don't possess at this moment.
#### These parts are: 
 - Item tubes - because I'm too dumb to understand how to transfer data; 
 - several structures (Multiblock Tank, Steam Tunnel) - for more info you'll have to check the main block or the valve, sorry.
#### Everything else is working just fine.
#### Make sure to check the Config (NUM0 by default)
